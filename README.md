ABSTRACT 
Importance: This study longitudinally assesses intra-network resting state functional connectivity (rs-fc) changes in the pathological progression to symptomatic Alzheimer disease (AD). Rs-fc changes were assessed with respect to the current Amyloid-Tau-Neurodegeneration (A-T-N) biomarker framework for AD. 
Objective: 1) Identify a global rs-fc signature, composed of a weighted combination of intra-network connections, that differentiated cognitively normal individuals from symptomatic AD. 2) Assess when changes in the intra-network rs-fc signature occur relative to symptomatic conversion to AD. 3) Evaluate the intra-network rs-fc signature with regards to AD biomarkers previously encapsulated by the A-T-N framework
Design, Setting, and Participants: We analyzed intra-network rs-fc in a longitudinal cohort of cognitively normal older individuals (n = 335) followed at the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center who did or did not subsequently develop sporadic AD. Biomarkers, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (AÎ²42 and tau), structural magnetic resonance imaging (volumetrics), and positron emission tomography (PET) amyloid and tau were obtained.
Results: The main source of variance in intra-network rs-fc signature was primary sensory networks. Intra-network rs-fc changes occurred more than three years before conversion to symptomatic AD. Intra-network rs-fc was most strongly correlated with markers of neurodegeneration and not amyloid or tau biomarkers.
Conclusions and Relevance: Changes in intra-network rs-fc occur near conversion to symptomatic AD and could serve as a biomarker for evaluating potential therapies later in disease progression. Our results suggest that intra-network rs-fc is a neurodegenerative biomarker in the currently proposed A-T-N framework.
