This is the code associated with the analysis for Functional Connectivity Changes Associated with Conversion to Alzheimer Disease
This manuscript was initially submitted in September 2019 to Alzheimer's and Dementia.


ABSTRACT 
Objectives: 1) Identify a resting state functional connectivity (rs-fc) signature that differentiates cognitively normal individuals from symptomatic Alzheimer Disease (AD). 2) Assess when longitudinal changes in rs-fc occur relative to conversion to symptomatic AD. 3) Evaluate rs-fc intranetwork connectivity with regards to AD biomarkers using an Amyloid-Tau(Neurodegeneration) (AT(N)) framework
Methods: A global rs-fc signature was analyzed in a longitudinal cohort (n = 335). Biomarkers, including cerebrospinal fluid (AÎ²42 and tau), structural magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography were obtained.
Results: Rs-fc measures that emphasized global intranetwork connectivity distinguished cognitively normal individuals from symptomatic AD better than individual intranetwork connections. Changes occurred nearly four years before conversion to symptomatic AD. Intranetwork rs-fc signature most strongly correlated with neurodegeneration markers. 
Conclusions: Change in rs-fc occurred near symptomatic onset and is likely a neurodegenerative biomarker within the AT(N) framework. Rs-fc changes could serve as a biomarker for evaluating potential therapies.
